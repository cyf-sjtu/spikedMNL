This folder contains the code files for generating synthetic data and calibrating choice models accordingly

choose_product.m simulates the choice behavior of customers.

gam_log_lik.m mnl_log_lik.m smnl_log_lik.m are the likelihood functions of the three choice models.

Run mnl_vs_smnl.m for results in Section 8.1.1-8.1.3

Run compare_mnl_smnl.m and then output_compare_mnl_smnl.m for results in Section 8.1.4
